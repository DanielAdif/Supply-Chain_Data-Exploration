# SupplyChainAnalytics

This dataset is about about supply chain health commodity shipment and pricing data. Specifically, the data set identifies Antiretroviral (ARV) and HIV lab shipments to supported countries.

This notebook separates into:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Outlier Testing on Regression and Classification Problem

The method being used to handle outliers is log transform for both linear and classification model, and we want to see how it will affect the model. For Regression model, we use RMSE, MAE, and r2 scoring method using cross validation.
